Server-side user and transaction components for SMS and Twitter based money exchange.

#History

The purpose of this system "burr" was to listen to SMS and Twitter firehose events that would trigger a financial transaction between two parties and was originally presented to YCombinator in the late Spring of 2013.

The platform was built mostly in my spare time and utilized for a number of competitions in NYC as I was preparing to exit Viacom.  It's general purpose in this form is to highlight:

- Usage of concurrency principals offered by Scala's (early) Actor implementation
- General application scaffolding and configuration
- Interplay of core Java, MongoDB data access, services and processing logic
